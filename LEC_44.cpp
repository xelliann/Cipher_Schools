/* we saw in class that the diffrence between x and x^2 is very large as the size of x increases the time taken
by the compiler to execute the code will increase a lot that in relation to x

so we need a code with complexity in kx

we need to ignore the constants (they dont matter in large data sets)
we need to ignore the lower order terms(at larger scale they diminish)
